Cloud Save

It's actually really amazing how many people now use Cloud Save. In fact, when I
first built this, I had no idea how anyone would possibly find this extension of
any practical use whatsoever. I still only have a vague idea as to how it could
be used, so this probably implies that I'm not the best maintainer of this project
but at least it's popular and rather awesome. Personally, I find drag2up much more
original, innovative and awesome.

Cloud Save is still pretty cool though. And it's not a terrible name, actually. Its
probably the one project of mine which actually has a fairly decent name.

Right now, I'm going to try doing development of cloud save on the cloud via the 
cloud9 IDE on a Cr-48. It's going pretty well so far and it's really awesome.
